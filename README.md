skiclub is a 'skipole' project.

From the Downloads section, the tar file can be downloaded, untarred and from the directory containing the skiclub directory, the project can be run with

python3 skiclub

This will open a web server which allows users to log in as members or administrators, and admin's can create further users.

As a stand-alone project it does little else! It is intended to be imported into the skipole framework, copied and adapted as required, to be the basis of a users own project.
