skiclub is a 'skipole' project.

As a stand alone project it can be untarred and from the directory containing the skiclub directory, the project can be run with

python3 skiclub

This will open a web server which allows users to log in as members or administrators, and admin's can create further users.

It is intended to be imported into the skipole framework, copied and adapted as required, to be the basis of a users own project.
