skiclub is a 'skipole' project.

Allows users to log in as members or administrators, and admin's can create further users.

As a stand-alone project it does little else! It is intended to be imported into the skipole framework, copied and adapted as required, to be the basis of a users own project.


**Redis**

The code is dependent on a Redis server being available and the Python3 Redis client package being installed.

The python3 redis client:

sudo apt-get install python3-redis



To run skiclub you will need skipole installing, and some understanding of that framework.
